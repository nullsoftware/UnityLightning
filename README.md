# Unity URP Lightning shader

Lightning shader for Unity URP, single bolt with 3D noise  
Renders a single animated lightning bolt with glow effect, defined by start and end positions  
The bolt itself rendered using ray marching algorithm

**WARNING**: Since this shader uses a ray marching algorithm, I do not recommend to use it in real-world projects due to performance limitations.
